<div>An outcome is said to be <b>efficient</b> if the economy is getting all it can from the scarce resources available (outside points of the graph). Points on the inside of the graph are said to be <b>inefficient</b>.The slope of the points on the Production
    Possibilities Frontier equal the <b>opportunity cost</b>, which illustrates the trade-off between outputs of different goods at different times.</div>

<div>The PPFs below show the trade-offs that that farmer and rancher face, but do not say what they will do. </div>

<br />
<div>The producer that requires a smaller quanities of inputs to produce a good is said to have an <b>absolute advantage</b> in producing that good over another producer. <i>(rate inputs)</i></div>
<img src="images/Farmer and Rancher Trade PPF.png" />
<div>*The rancher and farmer exchange 5 oz of meat (R=>F) for 15 oz of potatoes (F=>R). </div>
<br />
<div>The producer who gives up less of other goods to produce Good X has the smaller opportunity cost of producing Good X and is said to have the <b>comparative advantage</b> <i>(rate of outputs)</i>. 1 oz of potaotoes only costs the farmer 1/4 oz meat, but costs the rancher 1/2 ox meat, so the farmer has the comparative adavantage in growing potatoes. 1 oz of meat costs the rancher 2 oz of potatoes but costs the farmer 4 oz of potatoes, so the rancher has the comparative advantage of meat.</div>
<img src="images/Opportunity Cost of Meat and Potatoes.png" />
<div>The opportunity cost of meat is the inverse of the opportunity cost of potatoes. </div>

<hr>

<div>When each person specializes in producing the good for which he or she has a comparative advantage, total production in the economy rises. In the example above, since the farmer and rancher both have different opportunity costs, they both get a bargain out of the trade shown in figure 2. The farmer is paying 3oz of potatoes for each oz of meat, which is better than his opportunity cost of 4oz potatoes for each oz of meat. The rancher buys 1 oz of potatoes at a rate of 1/3 oz of meat, which is lower than her opportunity cost of 1/2 oz of meat.</div>
<br />
<div><i><b>For both parties to gain from trade, the price at which they trade must lie between the two opprtunity costs.</b></i> If the price of meat were below 2 oz of potatoes both the farmer and rancher would want to buy meat. Similarily, if the price of meat was above 4 oz of potatoes, both would want to sell meat. </div>
