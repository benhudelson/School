If  a firm can influence the market price a the good it sells, it is said to have <b>market power</b>. <br /><br />

A <b>competitive market</b> is a market with many buyers and sellers trading identical products so that each buyer and seller is a price taker.  <br /><br />


Buyers and sellers in competitive markets must accept the price the market determines and, therefore, are said to be <i>price takers</i>. <br /><br /> 
<hr>
Average Revenue = TR / Q => <i>for all firms, average revenue equals the price of the good.</i> <br /><br />

<b>Marginal Revenue</b> the change in total revenue from an additional unit sold. <br /><br />

Average Revenue = TR / Q <br /><br />
Marginal Revenue = &#9651;TR / &#9651;Q <br /><br />

</div>
<hr>
<div>
The profit mazimizing quantity can be found by comparing the marginal revenue to the marginal cost for each unit produced. <br />

  When marginal cost is less than marginal revenue, an increase in the quantity of production by 1 unit yields a greater profit. When marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue, a decrease in the quantity of production by 1 yeilds a greater profit. The profit maximizing level of output is reached when marginal revenue and marginal cost are exactly equal.

  <i>Because a firm's marginal-cost curve determines the quantity of the good the firm is willing to upply at any price, the marginal-cost curve is also the competitive firm's supply curve. </i>

A <b>shutdown</b> refers to a short-run decision not to produce anything during a specific period of time because of current market conditions. <br /><br />
An <b>exit</b> refers to a long-run decision to leave the market.<br /><br />

A firm that shuts down still has to pay its fixed costs whereas a firm that exits does not have to pay any costs at all, fixed or variable. So a firm shuts down if the revenue that it would earn from producing is less than its variable costs of production.<br /><br />
Shutdown if TR < VC => TR/Q < VC/Q => P < AVC
<br />
<br /> 

</div>
<hr>
<div>A <b>sunk cost</b> is a cost that has already been committed and cannot be recovered.
<br /><br />
Exit if TR < TC => TR/Q < TC/Q => P < ATC</div>
<br /><br />
Enter if P > ATC
<hr>
<div><i>The competitive firm's long-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost curve that lies above the average total cost. </i></div>

<hr>
<div>A <b>marginal firm</b> is the firm that would exit the market if the price were any lower.<br /><br>
<i>Because firms can enter and exit more easily in the long run than in the short run the long-run supply curve is typically more elastic that the short-run supply curve.</i>
