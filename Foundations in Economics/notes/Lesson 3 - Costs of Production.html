The amount that a firm receives for the sale of its output is called its <b>total rvenue</b>. The amount that the firm pays to buy inputs is called its <b>total cost</b>. The total revenue minus total cost is a firm's <b>profit</b>.
</div>
<br />
<div><b>Excplicit costs</b> are costs that require an outlat of money by the firm (wages, equipment, etc.). <b>Implicit costs</b> are costs that do not require an outlay of money by the firm (using another skill for wages, income lost from reinvesting capital into a business, etc.).</div>
<hr>
<div><b>Economic profit</b> is the total revenue minus the total cost, including both implicit and explicit costs. <b>Accounting profit</b> is the total revenue minus the explicit cost. </div>
<hr>
<div>The relationship between quantity of inputs used to make a good and the quantity of output of that good is the <b>production function</b></div><br /><br />
The <b>marginal product</b> is the increase in output that arises from an additional unit of input. <br /><br />

<hr>
<div>A <b>diminishing marginal product</b> is the property whereby the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases.</div>
<hr>
<div>
  A <b>fixed cost</b> is a cost that does not vary with the quantity of output produced. <br /><br />
  <b>Variable cost</b> is a cost that varies with the quantity of output produced. <br /><br />
  <b>Average variable cost</b> is the variable cost divided by the quantity of output. <br /><br />
  <b>Average total cost</b> is the total cost divided by the quantity of output. <br /><br />
  <b>Marginal cost</b> is the increase in total cost that arises from an extra unity of production. <br /><br />

  The <b>efficient scale</b> is the quantityt of output that minimizes average total cost. <br /><br />
  <i>Whenever marginal cost is less than average total cost, average total cost is falling. Whenever marginal cost is greater than average total cost, avergae total cost is rising. </i>

  <ul>
    <li>Marginal cost eventually rises with the quantity of output.</li>
    <li>The average-total-cost curve is U-shaped.</li>
    <li>The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the minimum of average total cost.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<hr>
<div>
<b>Economies of scale</b> is the property whereby long-run average total cost falls as the quantity of output increases. <br /><br />
<b>Diseconomies of scale</b> is the property whereby long-run average total cost rises as the quantity of output increases. <br /><br />
<b>Constant returns of scale</b> is the property whereby long-run average total costs stays the same as the quantity of output changes. <br /><br />
