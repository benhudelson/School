<div>Price elasticity of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded) / (&#9651;% price)<br /><br />
  
Income elasticity of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded) / (&#9651;% income)<br /><br />

Cross Price of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded of good 1) / (&#9651;% price of good 2)<br /><br />

Elasticity of Supply = (&#9651;% quantity supplied) / (&#9651;% price)<br /><br />

Elasticity of Supply = (&#9651;% quantity supplied) / (&#9651;% price) = 20% / 10% = 2.0 <br /><br />

  Consumer Surplus = Value to buyers - Amount paid by buyers <br /><br />
  
  Producer surplus = Amount received by sellers - cost to sellers <br /><br />
  
  Total Surplus = Value to buyers - cost to sellers <br /><br />

  Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost <br /><br />
  Average Total Cost = Total Cost / Quantity <br /><br />
  Marginal Cost = &#9651;TC / &#9651;Q <br /><br />

  Total Revenue = P X Q <br /><br />
  Average Revenue = TR / Q <br /><br />
  Marginal Revenue = &#9651;TR / &#9651;Q <br /><br />
  Marginal Cost = &#9651;TC / &#9651;Q <br /><br />
  Change in profit = Marginal Revenue - Marginal Cost = &#9651;TR / &#9651;Q -  &#9651;TC / &#9651;Q = (&#9651;TR- &#9651;TC) / &xutri;Q<br /><br />
  
  For a firm operating in a competitive market, profit maximizing output is produced when MR = MC. <br /><br />
  
  The efficient scale for a firm occurs when ATC = MC. <br /><br />

</div>
<div>
  Profit = TR - TC = (TR/Q - TC/Q) * Q = (P - ATC) * Q<br /><br />

  If P < AVC, then a firm should shut down (short term)<br /><br />
  If P < ATC, then a firm should exit (long term) <br /><br  />

  Y = C + I + G + NX<br />
  where Y = GDP, C = consumption, I = investment, G = goverment purchases, and NX = net exports<br /><br />
  GDP Deflator = (GDP / real GDP) X 100<br /><br />
