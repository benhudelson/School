<div>Price elasticity of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded) / (&#9651;% price)<br /><br />
  
Income elasticity of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded) / (&#9651;% income)<br /><br />

Cross Price of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded of good 1) / (&#9651;% price of good 2)<br /><br />

Elasticity of Supply = (&#9651;% quantity supplied) / (&#9651;% price)<br /><br />

Elasticity of Supply = (&#9651;% quantity supplied) / (&#9651;% price) = 20% / 10% = 2.0 <br /><br />

  For a firm operating in a competitive market, profit maximizing output is produced when MR = MC. <br /><br />
  
  The efficient scale for a firm occurs when ATC = MC. <br /><br />
