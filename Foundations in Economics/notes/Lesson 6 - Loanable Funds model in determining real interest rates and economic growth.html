    <b>productivity</b> is the quantity of goods and services produced from each unit of labor input.<br /><br />

    <b>factors of production</b> are the inputs used to produce goods and services - labor, capital, and so on<br /><br /> The four determinants of a countrys productivity:
    <ul>
        <li><b>physical capital</b> is the stock of equipment and structures that are used to produce goods and services.</li>
        <li><b>human capital</b> is the knowledge and skills that workers acquire through education, training, and experience
        </li>
        <li><b>natural resources</b> are the inputs into the production of goods and services that are provided by nature, such as by land, rivers, and mineral deposits. The come in two forms: <i>renewable</i> and <i>nonrenewable</i></li>
        <li><b>technological knowledge</b> is society's understanding of the best ways to produce goods and services. It refers to society's understanding of how the world works whereas human capital refers to the resources expended transmitting this understanding.

    <b>diminishing returns</b> is the property whereby the benefit from an extra unit of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases.<br /><br />
    <i>When workers already have a large quantity of capital to use in producing goods and services, giving them an additional unit of capital increases their productivity only slightly.</i><br /><br />

    <i>In the long run, the higher saving rate leads to a higher level of productivity and income but not to higher growth in these variables.</i> - ie productivity and income is increased from savings, but the growth rate eventually returns to its normal
    rate.
    <br /><br /> The <b> catch up effect </b>is the proerty whereby countries that start off poor tend to grow more rapidly than countries that start off rich.<br /><br /> A capital investment that is owned and operated by a foreign entity is called a
    <b>foreign direct investment</b>.<br /><br /> An investment that is financed with foreign money but operated by domestic residents is called <b>foreign portfolio investments</b>.<br /><br />
