<div>A <b>market</b> is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service., where buyers determine the demand for a product and sellers determine the supply.</div>
<div>The term <b>competitive market</b> is used to describe a market in which there are so many buys and so many sellers that each has a negligible impact on the market price. A <b>perfectly competitive</b> market has two characteristics: 1) the goods offered for sale are all exactly the same and 2) the buyers and sellers are so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market. In a perfectly competivite market, buyers and sellers must accept the price the market determines so they are called <i>price takers</i>; buyers can buy all they want and sellers can sell all they want.</div>
<hr>
<div>The <b>quantity demanded</b> of any good is the amount of good that buyers are willing and able to purchase. <b>The law of demand</b>: other things equal when the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded of the good falls, and when the price falls, the quantity demanded rises. A <b>demand schedule</b> shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded, holding constant everything else that influences how much of the good consumers want to buy. </div>

<hr>
<div>If the demand falls for a good when income falls, the good is called a <b>normal good</b>. If the demand for a good rises when income falls, the good is called an <b>inferior good</b>. Example of inferior good is bus tickets.  </div>
<div>When a fall in the price of one good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called <b>substitutes</b>. Examples: ice cream and frozen yogurt, hamburgers and hotdogs, sweaters and sweatshirts, movie tickets and movie rentals.</div>
<div>When the fall in the price of one good raises the demand for another good, the two goods are called <b>complements</b>. Examples: gasoline and cars, computers and software, peanut butter and jelly. </div>

<hr>
<div>The <b>quantity supplied</b> of any good or service is the amount that sellers are willing and able to sell. The <b>law of supply</b> states that: other things being equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of the good also rises, and when the price falls, the quantity supplied falls as well. The curve relating price and supply is called the <b>supply curve</b> and curves upwards because the higher the price the greater the quantity supplied.</div>
<img src="images\Supply curve.png" />

<hr>
<div>The point at which the supply curve and demand curve intersect is called the <b>equilibrium</b> and the price at that point is called the <b>equilibrium price</b> or <b>market-clearing price</b>. <i>At the equilibrium price, the quantity of the good that buyers are willing and able to buy  exactly balances the quantity that sellers are willing and able to sell.</i></div>
<hr>
<div>A <b>surplus</b> of a good or <i>excess supply</i> is when suppliers are unable to sell all the want at the going price. A <b>shortage</b> or <i>excess demand</i> occurs when demanders are unable to buy all they want at the going price. </div>
<img src="images\Shortage vs Surplus.png" />
<hr>
<div><i>Supply</i> refers to the position of the supply curve whereas <i>quantity supplied</i> refers to the amount suppliers wish to sell. <i>Change in demand</i> refers to a shift in the demand curve.<i>Change in supply</i> refers to a shift in the supply curve. MOvement along a fixed demand curve is called a <i>change in the quantity demanded</i>.</div>
<hr>
<h5>Three steps to analyzing changes in Equilibrium</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Decide whether the event shifts the dupply curve, the demand curve, or both</li>
  <li>decide whether the curve shifts to the right or the left</li>
  <li>Use the supply-and-demand diagram to compare the initial and new equilibrium</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<div>The <b>price elasticity of demand</b> measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. Goods are <b>elastic</b> if the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. Necessities tend to have inelastic demand and luxuries tend to have elastic demand. </div>
<div>Price elasticity of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded) / (&#9651;% price)</div>
<div>Demand is <i>elastic</i> when the elasticity is greater than 1, which means the quantity moves proportionately more than the price. Demand is considered <i>inelastic</i> when the elasticity is less than 1, which means the quantity moves the proportionately less than the price. If the elastcity is exactly 1, the quantity moves the same amount proportionately as the pirce, and demand is said to have unit elasticity. </div>
<div>Rule of thumb about demand curve: The flatter the demand curve at a point, the greater the elasticity of demand. The steeper at a point, the smaller the elascticity of demand.</div>

<hr>
<div>The <b>total revenue</b> is the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of a good. P X Q - price of the good times the quantity sold. The height of the box of the demand curve is P and the width is Q.</div>
<img src="images\Total Revenue.png" />
<hr>
<div>If a good is inelastic, an increase in price will yield an increase in revenue. If a good is elastic an increase in price will yield a decrease in revenue. </div>
<img src="images\Changes to Total Revenue.png" />
<ul>
  <li>When demand is inelastic (price elasticity < 1), price and total revenue move in the same direction</li>
  <li>When demand is elastic (price elasticity > 1), price and total revenue move in the opposite direction</li>
  <li>If demand is unit elastic, total revenue remains constant when the price changes</li>

<hr>
<div>The <b>income of elasticity of demand</b> measures how the quantity demanded changes as the consumer income changes.</div>
<div>Income elasticity of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded) / (&#9651;% income)</div>
<div>The <b>croos-price elasticity of demand</b> measures how the quantity demanded changes as the good responds to the change in price of another good..</div>
<div>Income elasticity of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded of good 1) / (&#9651;% price of good 2)</div>
