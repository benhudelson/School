<div>A <b>market</b> is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service., where buyers determine the demand for a product and sellers determine the supply.</div>
<div>The term <b>competitive market</b> is used to describe a market in which there are so many buys and so many sellers that each has a negligible impact on the market price. A <b>perfectly competitive</b> market has two characteristics: 1) the goods offered
    for sale are all exactly the same and 2) the buyers and sellers are so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market. In a perfectly competivite market, buyers and sellers must accept the price the market determines so
    they are called <i>price takers</i>; buyers can buy all they want and sellers can sell all they want.</div>
<hr>
<div>The <b>quantity demanded</b> of any good is the amount of good that buyers are willing and able to purchase. <b>The law of demand</b>: other things equal when the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded of the good falls, and when the price falls,
    the quantity demanded rises. A <b>demand schedule</b> shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded, holding constant everything else that influences how much of the good consumers want to buy. </div>

<hr>
<div>If the demand falls for a good when income falls, the good is called a <b>normal good</b>. If the demand for a good rises when income falls, the good is called an <b>inferior good</b>. Example of inferior good is bus tickets. </div>
<div>When a fall in the price of one good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called <b>substitutes</b>. Examples: ice cream and frozen yogurt, hamburgers and hotdogs, sweaters and sweatshirts, movie tickets and movie rentals.</div>
<div>When the fall in the price of one good raises the demand for another good, the two goods are called <b>complements</b>. Examples: gasoline and cars, computers and software, peanut butter and jelly. </div>
<hr>

<hr>
<div>The <b>quantity supplied</b> of any good or service is the amount that sellers are willing and able to sell. The <b>law of supply</b> states that: other things being equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of the good also rises,
    and when the price falls, the quantity supplied falls as well. The curve relating price and supply is called the <b>supply curve</b> and curves upwards because the higher the price the greater the quantity supplied.</div>
<img src="images\Supply curve.png" />
<img src="images\Market supply.png" />
<hr>
<div>The point at which the supply curve and demand curve intersect is called the <b>equilibrium</b> and the price at that point is called the <b>equilibrium price</b> or <b>market-clearing price</b>. <i>At the equilibrium price, the quantity of the good that buyers are willing and able to buy  exactly balances the quantity that sellers are willing and able to sell.</i></div>
<hr>
<div>A <b>surplus</b> of a good or <i>excess supply</i> is when suppliers are unable to sell all the want at the going price. A <b>shortage</b> or <i>excess demand</i> occurs when demanders are unable to buy all they want at the going price. </div>
<img src="images\Shortage vs Surplus.png" />
<hr>
<div><i>Supply</i> refers to the position of the supply curve whereas <i>quantity supplied</i> refers to the amount suppliers wish to sell. <i>Change in demand</i> refers to a shift in the demand curve.<i>Change in supply</i> refers to a shift in the supply
    curve. MOvement along a fixed demand curve is called a <i>change in the quantity demanded</i>.</div>
<hr>
<h5>Three steps to analyzing changes in Equilibrium</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Decide whether the event shifts the dupply curve, the demand curve, or both</li>
    <li>decide whether the curve shifts to the right or the left</li>
    <li>Use the supply-and-demand diagram to compare the initial and new equilibrium</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<div>The <b>price elasticity of demand</b> measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. Goods are <b>elastic</b> if the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. Necessities tend to have inelastic demand and luxuries tend to
    have elastic demand. </div>
<div>Price elasticity of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded) / (&#9651;% price)</div>
<div>Demand is <i>elastic</i> when the elasticity is greater than 1, which means the quantity moves proportionately more than the price. Demand is considered <i>inelastic</i> when the elasticity is less than 1, which means the quantity moves the proportionately
    less than the price. If the elastcity is exactly 1, the quantity moves the same amount proportionately as the pirce, and demand is said to have unit elasticity. </div>
<div>Rule of thumb about demand curve: The flatter the demand curve at a point, the greater the elasticity of demand. The steeper at a point, the smaller the elascticity of demand.</div>

<hr>
<div>The <b>total revenue</b> is the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of a good. P X Q - price of the good times the quantity sold. The height of the box of the demand curve is P and the width is Q.</div>
<img src="images\Total Revenue.png" />
<hr>
<div>If a good is inelastic, an increase in price will yield an increase in revenue. If a good is elastic an increase in price will yield a decrease in revenue. </div>
<img src="images\Changes to Total Revenue.png" />
<ul>
    <li>When demand is inelastic (price elasticity
        < 1), price and total revenue move in the same direction</li>
            <li>When demand is elastic (price elasticity > 1), price and total revenue move in the opposite direction</li>
            <li>If demand is unit elastic, total revenue remains constant when the price changes</li>

</ul>

<hr>
<div>The <b>income of elasticity of demand</b> measures how the quantity demanded changes as the consumer income changes.</div>
<div>Income elasticity of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded) / (&#9651;% income)</div>
<div>The <b>cross-price elasticity of demand</b> measures how the quantity demanded changes as the good responds to the change in price of another good..</div>
<div>Cross-price of demand = (&#9651;% quantity demanded of good 1) / (&#9651;% price of good 2)</div>
<div>Positive cross-price elasticity of demand implies substitutions, whereas negative implies complements.</div>
<hr>
<div>The law of spupply states that higher prices raise the quantity supplied. The <b>price elasticity of supply</b> measures how much the quantity supplied responds to changes in the price. Supply of a good is said to be <i>elastic</i> if the quantity supplied
    responds substantially to changes in the price and <i>inelastic</i> if it only responds slightly to changes in price.</div><br />
<div>Examples of inelastic supply:</div>
<ul>
    <li>beachfront property</li>
    <li>petrol</li>
    <li>salt</li>
</ul>
<div>Examples of elastic supply:</div>
<ul>
    <li>manufactured goods</li>
    <li>computers</li>
    <li>books</li>
</ul>
<div>Supply is usually more elastic in the long run and inelastic in the short term due to the market's ability to respond to change.</div><br />
<div>Elasticity of Supply = (&#9651;% quantity supplied) / (&#9651;% price)</div><br />
<div style="text-decoration: underline;">Example: an increase in the price of milk from $2.85 to $3.15 a gallon raises that amount that dairy farmers produce from 9,000 to 11,000.</div>
<div>&#9651;% price = ((3.15 - 2.85)/3.00) x 100 = 10% </div>
<div>&#9651;% quantity supplied = ((11,000-9,000)/10,000) x 100 = 20% </div>
<div>Elasticity of Supply = (&#9651;% quantity supplied) / (&#9651;% price) = 20% / 10% = 2.0 </div>

<hr>
<div>Farming technology has changed farming since 1950. IN 1950, 17% of the labor force worked on farms. Today 2% of the labor force work on farms. Despite this farms produce more than twice the output they did in 1950. Certain programs exist to prevent farmers
    from producing on all their land. This keeps the supply down. With inelastic demand for their products, farmers as a group receive a greater total revenue, if they sypply a smaller crop to the market. </div><br />
<div>OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries)</div>
<div>In the short run both the supply and demand for oil are relatively inelastic. Supply is inelastic because the quanity of known oil reserves and the capacity for oil extraction cannot be changed quickly. Demand is inelastic because buying habits do not
    respond immediately to price changes. Over long periods of time, producers of oil outside OPEC respond to high prices by increaseing oil explorations and building new extraction capacity. Consumers respond with greater conservation, such as by replacing
    cars with more efficient ones. </div>

<div><b>Welfare economics</b> is the study of how the allocation of resources affects conomic well-being.</div>
<div>A buyer's maximum is called his <b>willingness to pay</b> and it measures what how much each buyer values the good. A <b>consumer surplus</b> is the amount a buyer is willing to pay for a good minus the amount the buyer actually pays for it. </div>
<img src="images\Demand schedule and demand curve.png" />

<div><i>The area below the demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market.</i></div><br />
<img src="images\How price affects consumer surplus.png" />

<hr>
<div><b>Cost</b> is the value of everything a seller must give up to produce a good. A <b>producer surplus</b> is the amount a seller is paid minus the cost of production - ie the benefit sellers receive from participation in a market.</div>
<img src="images\supply-schedule-of-the-supply-curve.png" />

<div>A <i>marginal seller</i> is the seller who would leave the market first if the price were any lower.</div><br />
<img src="images\producer-surplus-with-the-supply-curve.png" />
<div><i>The area below the price and above the supply curve represent the producer surplus in a market.</i></div>
<hr>
<div>The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is the <b>total surplus</b>. <b>Efficiency</b> is the property of resource allocation of maximizing the total surplus received by all members of society. If an allocation of resources mazimizes total surplus, we say that allocation exhibits efficiency.</div>
<div><u>Example:</u> An allocation is inefficient if a good is not being produced by sellers with lowest cost.</div>

<hr>
<div>Insights about market outcomes</div>
<div><ul>
  <li>Free markets allocate the supply of goods to the buyers who value them most highly, as measured by their willingness to pay.</li>
  <li>Free marks allocate the demand for goods to the sellers who can produce them at the lowest cost.</li>
  <li>Free markets produce the quantity of goods that maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus.</li>
</ul>
  
</div>
<hr>
<div>The ability to influence prices is called <i>market power</i> and it can cause markets to be ineffcient because it keeps the price and quantity away from the equilibrium of supply and demand.</div>
<hr>

<h3>Take aways</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When demand is inelastic price and total revenue move in the same direction. When prices rise with inelastic demand, the total revenue will increase.</li>
