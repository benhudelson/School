<div>A <b>market</b> is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service., where buyers determine the demand for a product and sellers determine the supply.</div>
<div>The term <b>competitive market</b> is used to describe a market in which there are so many buys and so many sellers that each has a negligible impact on the market price. A <b>perfectly competitive</b> market has two characteristics: 1) the goods offered for sale are all exactly the same and 2) the buyers and sellers are so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market. In a perfectly competivite market, buyers and sellers must accept the price the market determines so they are called <i>price takers</i>; buyers can buy all they want and sellers can sell all they want.</div>

<div>The <b>quantity demanded</b> of any good is the amount of good that buyers are willing and able to purchase. <b>The law of demand</b>: other things equal when the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded of the good falls, and when the price falls, the quantity demanded rises. A <b>demand schedule</b> shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded, holding constant everything else that influences how much of the good consumers want to buy. </div>

<div>If the demand falls for a good when income falls, the good is called a <b>normal good</b>. If the demand for a good rises when income falls, the good is called an <b>inferior good</b>. Example of inferior good is bus tickets.  </div>
<div>When a fall in the price of one good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called <b>substitutes</b>. Examples: ice cream and frozen yogurt, hamburgers and hotdogs, sweaters and sweatshirts, movie tickets and movie rentals.</div>
<div>When the fall in the price of one good raises the demand for another good, the two goods are called <b>complements</b>. Examples: gasoline and cars, computers and software, peanut butter and jelly. </div>

<div>The <b>quantity supplied</b> of any good or service is the amount that sellers are willing and able to sell. The <b>law of supply</b> states that: other things being equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of the good also rises, and when the price falls, the quantity supplied falls as well. The curve relating price and supply is called the <b>supply curve</b> and curves upwards because the higher the price the greater the quantity supplied.</div>
